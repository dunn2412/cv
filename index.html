        <p>
          I have been working at JS since 1998. I attended Northeastern State
          University from 1999-2003. I received my Bachelors Degree in Management
          Information Systems. I then returned to work at JS Valve. My cousin
          Nick and I purchased JS from our grandmother in 2014. I met my wife
          Brittany in 2013. I knew pretty early on that she would be the woman
          that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. So I did and today
          we are happily married with three children. Dawsyn Rosalee
          Dunn, John Michael Dunn, and Baker Brooks Dunn
